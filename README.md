## Gud API discontinued

From today (30th December 2021), Gud API is discontinued; massive thanks to everyone who supported me on this journey <3. I truly appreciate it. Why is it discontinued you ask? Because someone is attacking this API sending requests at light speed making it slow and basically rendering my API unusable. Whoever is DDoSing my API, if you're reading this message. 1) Fuck you; 2) Hope you're happy now that your wish has been granted. The GitHub repo will still exist, feel free to fork it. Sayonara everyone, and thanks again for all the support <3.


## TL;DR
Gud API is henceforth discontinued because someone is DDoSing it rendering unsuable.
